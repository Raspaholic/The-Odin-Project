To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor 
element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we 
want to be a link with a <a> tag.

An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element 
and always goes in the element’s opening tag. An attribute is made 
up of two parts, a name, and a value. In our case, we need to add a 
href (hyperlink reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. The 
value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go 
to.

By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a href 
attribute will look like plain text. If the href attribute is present, 
the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify 
it is a link. It’s worth noting you can use anchor tags to link to any 
kind of resource on the internet, not just other HTML documents. You 
can link to videos, pdf files, images, and so on, but for the most part, 
you will be linking to other HTML documents.
