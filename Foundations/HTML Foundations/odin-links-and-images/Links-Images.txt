To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor 
element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we 
want to be a link with a <a> tag.

An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element 
and always goes in the element’s opening tag. An attribute is made 
up of two parts, a name, and a value. In our case, we need to add a 
href (hyperlink reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. The 
value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go 
to.

By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a href 
attribute will look like plain text. If the href attribute is present, 
the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify 
it is a link. It’s worth noting you can use anchor tags to link to any 
kind of resource on the internet, not just other HTML documents. You 
can link to videos, pdf files, images, and so on, but for the most part, 
you will be linking to other HTML documents.

Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create:

Links to pages on other websites on the internet
Links to pages located on our own websites

Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute 
links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: 
protocol://domain/path. An absolute link will always contain the 
protocol and domain of the destination.

Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links. 
Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page 
on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the 
page we created the link on. Relative links only include the file path 
to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on.

But we will usually want to organize our website directories a little 
better. Normally we would only have the index.html at the root directory 
and all other HTML files in their own directory.

In many cases, this will work just fine; however, you can still run 
into unexpected issues with this approach. Prepending ./ before the 
link will in most cases prevent such issues. By adding ./ you are 
specifying to your code that it should start looking for the 
file/directory relative to the current directory.

To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. Unlike the other 
elements we have encountered so far, the <img> element is empty. Which 
means it doesn’t have a closing tag. Instead of wrapping content with 
an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using a 
src attribute which tells the browser where the image file is located. 
The src attribute works much like the href attribute for anchor tags. 
It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths.

What if we want to use the dog image in the about page? We would first 
have to go up one level out of the pages directory into its parent 
directory so we could then access the images directory. To go to the 
parent directory we need to use two dots in the relative filepath like 
this: ../. Let’s see this in action, within the body of the about.html 
file, add the following image below the heading we added earlier

First, we are going to the parent directory of the pages directory 
which is odin-links-and-images. Then, from the parent directory, 
we can go into the images directory. Finally, we can access the 
dog.jpg file.

Besides the src attribute, every image element should also have an 
alt (alternative text) attribute. The alt attribute is used to describe 
an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. 
It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to 
visually impaired users.
