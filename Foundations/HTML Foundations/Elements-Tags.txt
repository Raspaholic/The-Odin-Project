HTML (HyperTextMarkupLanguage): definest the structure and 
content of webpages
Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content
wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.
Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. 
They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets <>.
Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. 
They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is 
that they have a forward slash before the keyword.
