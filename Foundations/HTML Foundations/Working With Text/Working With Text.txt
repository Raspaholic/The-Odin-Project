If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the 
paragraph element, which will add a newline after each of our 
paragraphs. A paragraph element is defined by wrapping text content 
with a <p> tag.

Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are 
displayed larger and bolder than other text to signify that they 
are headings. There are 6 different levels of headings starting from 
<h1> to <h6>. The number within a heading tag represents that headingâ€™s 
level. h1 is the most important and is larger than the other headings, 
and h6 is the lowest level and therefore the smallest of the headings.

The <strong> element makes text bold. It also semantically marks 
text as important; this affects tools, like screen readers, that users 
with visual impairments will rely on to use your website. The tone of 
voice on a screen reader will change to communicate the importance of 
the text within a strong element. To define a strong element we wrap 
text content in a <strong> tag.

The em element makes text italic. It also semantically places 
emphasis on the text, which again affects things like screen readers. 
To define an emphasised element we wrap text content in a <em> tag.

You may have noticed that in all the examples in this lesson we 
indent any elements that are within other elements. This is known as 
nesting elements. When we nest elements within other elements, we 
create a parent and child relationship between them. The nested 
elements are the children and the element they are nested within is 
the parent.

HTML comments are not visible to the browser; they allow us to 
comment on our code so that other developers or our future selves can 
read them and get some context about something that might not be clear 
in the code. Writing an HTML comment is simple: we just put <!-- and --> 
at either end of the comment.
