If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the 
paragraph element, which will add a newline after each of our 
paragraphs. A paragraph element is defined by wrapping text content 
with a <p> tag.

Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are 
displayed larger and bolder than other text to signify that they 
are headings. There are 6 different levels of headings starting from 
<h1> to <h6>. The number within a heading tag represents that headingâ€™s 
level. h1 is the most important and is larger than the other headings, 
and h6 is the lowest level and therefore the smallest of the headings.

The <strong> element makes text bold. It also semantically marks 
text as important; this affects tools, like screen readers, that users 
with visual impairments will rely on to use your website. The tone of 
voice on a screen reader will change to communicate the importance of 
the text within a strong element. To define a strong element we wrap 
text content in a <strong> tag.
