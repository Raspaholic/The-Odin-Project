Divs and spans give no particular meaning to their content. They are 
just generic boxes that can contain anything. We can give an id or 
class so we can target them for styling with CSS. Another use case we 
will face regularly is grouping related elements under one parent 
element to position them on the page correctly. Divs and spans provide 
us with the ability to do this. 

Div is a block-level element by default. It is commonly used as a 
container element to group other elements. Divs allow us to divide the 
page into different blocks and apply styling to those blocks.

Span is an inline-level element by default. It is commonly used to 
group text content and inline HTML elements so we can apply styling to 
them.
