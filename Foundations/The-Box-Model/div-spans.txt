ivs and spans, on the other hand, give no particular meaning to their 
content. They are just generic boxes that can contain anything. We will 
often need elements that serve no other purpose than to be “hook” 
elements we can give an id or class so we can target them for styling 
with CSS. Another use case we will face regularly is grouping related 
elements under one parent element to position them on the page 
correctly. Divs and spans provide us with the ability to do this.

Div is a block-level element by default. It is commonly used as a 
container element to group other elements. Divs allow us to divide the 
page into different blocks and apply styling to those blocks.
