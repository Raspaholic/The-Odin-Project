The most confusing thing about flexbox is that it can work either 
horizontally or vertically, and the way some rules work changes a bit 
depending on which direction you are working with. The default 
direction for a flex container is horizontal, or row, but you can 
change the direction to vertical, or column.

Axes
No matter which direction youâ€™re using, you need to think of your 
flex-containers as having 2 axes: the main axis and the cross axis. 
It is the direction of these axes that changes when the flex-direction 
is changed. In most circumstances, flex-direction: row puts the main 
axis horizontal (left-to-right), and column puts the main axis 
vertical (top-to-bottom).
