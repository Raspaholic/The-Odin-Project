The Inspector
To open up the inspector, you can right-click on any element of a 
webpage and click “Inspect Element” or press F12. For example, if you 
navigate to our homepage and open the inspector, you might see 
something that looks a little bit like the image below. (Note that if 
you are already logged in to TOP you will not see the page shown below. 
If you want to stay logged in, use Incognito mode or your browser’s 
equivalent to separately view the page.) 

In the Elements pane, you can see the entire HTML structure of your 
page. You can click on any of the elements in this pane to select that 
specific element. Alternatively, you can click the blue-highlighted 
icon shown below on the left, and hover over any element on the page. 
When an element is selected, the Styles tab will show all the currently 
applied styles, as well as any styles that are being overwritten 
(indicated by a strikethrough of the text).

The Styles pane also allows you to edit styles directly in the browser. 
You can click inside of any individual selector to add a new rule or 
click on an existing attribute or value to alter it.
