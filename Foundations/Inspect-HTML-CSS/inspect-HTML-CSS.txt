The Inspector
To open up the inspector, you can right-click on any element of a 
webpage and click “Inspect Element” or press F12. For example, if you 
navigate to our homepage and open the inspector, you might see 
something that looks a little bit like the image below. (Note that if 
you are already logged in to TOP you will not see the page shown below. 
If you want to stay logged in, use Incognito mode or your browser’s 
equivalent to separately view the page.)
