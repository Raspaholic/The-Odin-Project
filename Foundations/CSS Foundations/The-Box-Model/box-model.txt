The first important concept that you need to understand to be 
successful in CSS is the box model. It isn’t complicated, but skipping 
over it now will cause you much frustration down the line. Every 
single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can have 
other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another.

In the end, laying out a webpage and positioning all its elements is 
deciding how you are going to nest and stack these boxes. The only 
real complication here is that there are many ways to manipulate the 
size of these boxes, and the space between them, using padding, margin, 
and border.
*padding increases the space between the edge of a box and the content 
inside of it.
*margin increases the space between a box and any others that sit next 
to it.
*border adds space (even if it’s only a pixel or two) between the 
margin and the padding.

Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but with block-style 
padding and margin. Inline-block is a useful tool to know about, but in 
practice you’ll probably end up reaching for flexbox more often if 
you’re trying to line up a bunch of boxes.
